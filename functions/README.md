# Functions in MojoðŸ”¥

Mojo has two ways to declare a functions using `fn` or `def`. Both functions have the same result, but the `fn` function provides compile-time checks to ensure the function receives and returns the correct types. 

> [!WARNING]
> `def` function might fail at runtime if it receives the wrong type.
